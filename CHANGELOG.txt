[2.4]
- changes definition of density parameter logN for density gradient models (now at the minimum value at 25/9*rin instead of at rin, as it is much less sensitive on the spin
- implements additional caching for relxill to speed up evaluation for some cases
- adds new environment variable RELXILL_RENORMALIZE. If set, it renormalizes the full relxill model output to 1 cts/sec/keV/cm2 at 3keV. This setting can strongly help fitting algorithms and MCMC to converge, as the normalization does not, e.g., depend on the height anymore
- fixes installation issues with heasoft 6.35

[2.3]
- fixes issues for installation on Mac OS (removes complex.h from the code)

[2.2]:
- for the relxilllpCp model with beta>0, fixed a bug which resulted for some cases (very low height and large beta) in an over-estimated value of the fitted reflection fraction. Any fits done with switch_reflfrac_boost=1 are not affected, and also not the spectral shape, but only the value of the refl_frac parameter
- fixes memory leak if the ENV variable RELXILL_WRITE_FILES=1 was set - 2022-08-30

[2.1]:
- spectrum was not shifted correctly in energy and also the normalization was not calculated correctly
- for the Lamp Post models, improved how the normalization of the reflection emitted from each zone on the accretion disk is calculated. Previously, to calculate the normalization of the xillver reflection spectrum, the primary spectrum was taken with the cutoff energy (or kTe for nthcomp) as emitted from the primary source. Now, the normalization is calculated for each radial zone on the disk separately, taking into account the energy shift of the cutoff from the source to each zone on the disk when calculating the normalization. Note that this change only applies to the normalization; the energy shift of the cutoff energy for the spectrum itself has already been implemented since version 1.0.
- slightly increase the speed of the relxilllpCp model when including returning radiation - 2022-07-01

[2.0]: major update: includes returning radiation (Dauser et al., 2022) and adds a switch to allow a boost parameter instead of reflection fraction. Some parameter names were slightly changed to make the naming more consistent. - 2022-06-16

[1.4.3]: fixes small memory leak for the Cp-models using the standard tables - 2021-01-22

[1.4.2]: fixes memory problems if a 6-dim table was used - 2021-01-21

[1.4.1]: corrects the (loose) definition of the reflection fraction in the relxill (non-LP) type models, which now directly follows the xillver/pexrav definition of the flux. This implies that the normalization (i.e., the flux) now depends on the inclination as F=1/2*cos(incl). - 2021-01-06


[v1.4.0] improves the interpolation of the xillver reflection spectra. This mainly affects the logN parameter and the relative normalization of xillverD and relxillD type models. - 2020-10-07

[v1.3.10] Cp-type models can again be loaded using the standard xillver reflection table (xillver-comp.fits) - 2020-08-03

[v1.3.9] fixes model sometimes crashing for a few, specific values of spin - 2020-07-10

[v1.3.7] restricts Incl < 87 degrees in the lmodel.dat to be consistent with the provided tables - 2020-04-15

[v1.3.5] works with new heasoft and stricter compiler options - 2019-10-17

[v1.3.3] new model relxilllpionCp added, which provides the ionization gradient and a moving primary source, but now also for the nthcomp primary continuum. - 2019-08-09

[v1.3.2] add "beta" parmeter (velocity of the primary source) to the relxilllpion model - 2019-08-02

[v1.3.0] ionization gradient and high density models
    - Included model relxilllpion predicting an ionization gradient (more information is given in the model section)
    - Update of the high-density models (xillverD, relxillD) to include a larger range in Gamma up to 3.6 (table is now xillverD-5.fits) - 2019-07-12

[1.2.1] Update density table to xillverD-5.fits and change number of
Gamma bins accordingly (now Gamma extends up to 3.6)

[v1.2.0] reverting the wrong change for the emissivity profile introduced by 1.1.0, change (1). Information on the update from 1.0.x to 1.2.0 can be found in this pdf. Besides this change, the environment variable RELLINE_PHYSICAL_NORM has been added. If set to 1, it will return the acutal normalization of the relline and relconv type models (not recommended for fitting). - 2018-08-07

[1.1.0] major update and bug fix for the lamp post version of relxill:

  (1) the emissivity profile in the lamp post geometry has been
    corrected, leading to a steeper radial dependency

  (2) fixing a wrong normalization of the reflected spectrum, mainly
  affecting models with a large inclination angle

  (3) removing the re-normalization with RENORM_RELXILL_MODEL

  (4) updating the relativistic table, to achieve a more precise
  calculation of relativstic blurring for very low inclinations

[1.0.4] only applies to the LP model flavors fixed inconsistencies and
problems with the normalization of the reflection component of
relxilllp</tt> and <tt>relxilllpCp</tt>, affecting only LP sources at
large height (>20Rg) and Rout<1000 Rg, or with Rin>R_ISCO. The
spectral shape and therefore eventually fitting parameters were only
affected if <tt>fixReflFrac=1,2</tt> was set. Additionally, problems
with caching which sometimes occured when changing the inclination by
a large were also fixed.

[1.0.3] fixed relconv normalization (same now as for the previous
relxill version) and in <tt>relxilllpCp</tt> temperature is now
correctly given in the rest frame of the primary source

[1.0.2] solved segmentation fault if model was executed in folder
without write permission

[1.0.1]: added possiblity to change the re-normalization behaviour of
the models with the environment variable RENORM_RELXILL_MODEL.

[1.0.0]: first version of the new relxill model, including now
multiple zones for the LP-relxill model flavours. All other models
produce the same results, but all models are evaluated significantly
faster.
